# Digital-Humanities-project
The original data, Chalcolithic and early bronze age burials in northeast England, came from ads, archaeology data service in CSV format.
The Data was very messy, so it was cleaned, refined,  modified and simplified in OpenRefine to suit visualization. This took a long time, and many different versions of the Data were made, depending on what was relevant. 
The missing LatLong coordinates were converted and added so the data could be visualized in Palladio. 
Some simple visualiztions were made in Plotly.
More complex visualizations were made in Palladio and Raw.
