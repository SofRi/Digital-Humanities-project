The original data, Chalcolithic and early bronze age burials in northeast England, came from ads, archaeology data service in CSV format.
The Data was very messy, so it was cleaned, refined,  modified and simplified in OpenRefine to suit visualization. This took a long time, and many different versions of the Data were made, depending on what was relevant. 
The missing LatLong coordinates were converted and added so the data could be visualized in Palladio. 
Some simple visualiztions were made in Plotly.
More complex visualizations were made in Palladio and Raw. 
The focus was to use the data to visualize the relationship between sexes and artefact finds, but very quickly it became apparent that this data was not well suited to this, because such a large proportion of the sex determinations were either not available or indetermined. Based on such a small amount of sexed individuals, finds seem to distribute rarther evenly. Therefore this data cannot be used to give sclassifications to the unkown individuals based on artefact finds, because there doesn't seem to be any artefacts that seem to belong solely to any given sex.
